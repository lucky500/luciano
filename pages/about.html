				<h5><span class="first-paragraph">Hello, My name is Luciano Oliveira and I am a Front End Developer. I am married and I have 3 kids, I live in Boston (now Seattle), and that’s all she wrote...*</span></h5>
				<div class="hidden-paragraph">
					<p>*Well... since you still around, doesn't hurt to tell you a bit more about me. I like these things:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Coding</li>
						<li>Spending time with my beautiful wife, watching the sunset from Greenhill Park or watching a good movie</li>
						<li>My lovely kids</li>
						<li>Teaching math to my kids (not Really)</li>
						<li>Traveling</li>
					</ol>
					<p>I also love soccer, and watch my Brazilian team (Palmeiras) as much as I can. Love watching the Brazilian Soccer team play, and yes we are the best, no discussions about that. Don’t watch much of MLS… not sure why, I heard Seattle has a very good team. I like American Football as well, and Yes, I also root for the best team, the Patriots … That's how I roll when it comes to sports.</p>
					<p>I am originally from Sao Paulo, Brazil and I moved to the US in 1996. I was a Recruiter for the most part of my professional life, about 15 years, and I have been a Front End Developer for the past year. I am currently attending Epicodus to hone my skills, and yes they are awesome!</p>
					<p>Favorite bands include The Smiths, The Cure, U2, Pear Jam, New Order, David Bowie, Jamiroquai, Suede, The Clash, Echo & the Bunnymen, Beatles, Pixies, Talking Heads and More recently Young The Giant and Florence + The Machine. </p>
					<p>Movies and TV, definitely a big fan of Game of Thrones, Pulp Fiction (my all time favorite), Shawshank Redemption, The Commitments, City of God and more recently La La Land and Manchester by the Sea.</p>
